# Video-Impainting


# Video inpainting via GAN model.
•	GANs have been widely studied due to their enormous application prospect, 
including image and vision computing, video and language processing, etc. In 
this paper, the background of the GAN, theoretical models and extensional 
variants of GANs are introduced, where the variants can further optimise the 
original GAN or change the basic structures. Then the typical applications of 
•	GANs are explained. Finally, the existing problems of GANs are summarized and 
the future work of GANs models is given. Video inpainting or completion is a vital video improvement technique used to repair or edit digital videos. This paper describes a framework for temporally consistent video completion. The proposed method allows the removal of 
dynamic objects or restores missing or tainted regions presented in a video 
sequence by utilizing spatial and temporal information from neighbouring scenes. 
•	The masking algorithm is used for the detection of scratches or damaged portions 
in video frames. The algorithm iteratively performs the following operations: achieve frame; update the scene model; update positions of moving objects.

OpenCV is a good library. Nevertheless, the answer of whether it is good enough depends on your approach to the problem. OpenCV only assists you with the already implemented functions and models. OpenCV library is designed to solve many computers vision-related tasks like object detection, motion tracking, image manipulation, edge detection
 OpenCV is an open-source library with quite a number of useful services for image processing. As far as my experience goes, it really is the go-to library to start with if your application involves anything related to image processing. Some of the provided APIs are in fact implementations of classic algorithms.

OpenCV inpainting is implemented using the function in paint.
